#Sails Model Directory

ORM can be handled via [Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline) for interactions with models but these
models will correspond to tables we have within our data as we're using MySQL.

Documentation on Sails Models can be found [Here](http://sailsjs.org/#!documentation/models)
