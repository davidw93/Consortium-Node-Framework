#Sails Controller Directory

This directory contains all controllers for SailsJS. Controllers are essentially
the middleman between the models and the views, however we're not really going
to use views and instead just serve JSON from these controllers for Ember Data
to use.

Documentation on Sails Controllers can be found [Here](http://sailsjs.org/#!documentation/controllers)
